# Modeling Ant Scouting Behavior in Cities

Modeling ants scouting for food in a city and returning to nest.

## How to Run Individual Model (in progress of editing)

To run your own model, open up the ABM_city_of_choice notebook and edit where files are saved to a locaiton of your choice in the city class and in the food_pheromone class. Run all cells and input a city of your choice or pick one of the suggested ones, hit enter in that cell then pick the number of agents, number of food sources, and map size (km). Continue to run the 'Ant Generator" cell. Wait for the model to stop of hit pause on the notebookwhen you would like. Open up vid_from_images notebook and change the paths so the images can be accessed and the output path is what you want. Run the first cell to make the video. Run the second cell to delete all the images.
